# datacollection_car
scraping data from 
- cargurus,
- carmax,
- craigslist,
- edmunds

using 
- python
- selenium
- request and beautifulsoup

Result:
- CAPTCHA prevented the data collection
- for craigslist, since I focused on the craigslist title which was not standarized, I had to use regular expressions to create at least two useful columns
